# Clock-Using-FrontEnd-Development

1. HTML (Structure)

HTML creates the basic layout of the clock:

A circular clock container

Three hands: hour, minute, and second

JavaScript file is linked so the hands can move

2. CSS (Design/Styling)

CSS gives the clock its look and style:

Clock becomes a round circle

Hands are designed with different sizes and colors

The clock is placed at the center of the screen

Hands rotate from the center point

3. JavaScript (Working Logic)

JavaScript makes the clock move like a real clock:

Gets current hours, minutes, seconds

Converts time into degrees (rotation)

Rotates each hand smoothly

Updates clock every 1 second
